# Fantasy Writer

I wrote this prompt to demonstrate fantasy writing, as part of a blog post on [fivehundredwordsaday.com](https://www.fivehundredwordsaday.com/the_current_state_of_ai_writing).

## Instructions

Copy the contents of `prompt.md`, and into ChatGPT running GPT-4.

Sadly, it currently has to be GPT-4 to understand the complexities of the prompt.

You can pretty easily make some edits to the prompt to make it more your own. I'd suggest looking at the character array and filling that in, keeping in mind there's a size limit for the prompt and the LLMs memory.

You should also take a look at the storytelling _style_ section and make it more in line with what you like.

Other than that, let the imagination flow.

## Inputs and Commands

- It will ask you if you want to hear a story, you need to say something along the lines of "yes"
- It will ask for your fantasy universe's name, as well as it's "X Factor". The X Factor is just whatever makes it special. I.e., in Avatar: The Last Airbender, it's that people can bend elements (and then you'd want to describe it a bit more)
- Note that instead of using these inputs, you could edit the prompt to include those values directly in the prompt
- After a story, if you want it tweaked you can start the prompt with `/revise` followed by the changes you'd like

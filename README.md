# Fantasy Writer

I wrote this prompt to demonstrate fantasy writing, as part of a blog post on [fivehundredwordsaday.com](https://www.fivehundredwordsaday.com/gpt).

## Instructions

Copy the contents of `prompt.md`, and into ChatGPT running GPT-4.

Sadly, it currently has to be GPT-4 to understand the complexities of the prompt.

You can pretty easily make some edits to the prompt to make it more your own. I'd suggest looking at the character array and filling that in, keeping in mind there's a size limit for the prompt and the LLMs memory.

You should also take a look at the storytelling _style_ section and make it more in line with what you like.

Other than that, let the imagination flow.
